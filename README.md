## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project was amazing because i can learn how to use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content. And that was something totally new for me. I late a little but at the end i am happy with the result.

### Continued development

For the moment, i will continue with the newbie projects of Front end Mentor, maybe another three more and i will feel with enough confidence to level up the challenges.
